##  üöÄ&nbsp; Installation and Documentation

You will need to clone the code from [booki-backend](https://github.com/MetaPowerCoders/booki-backend.git).

1. To use this code, you <u>MUST</u> have the following installed:

    1. Docker - [find the link to install it here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    2. TablePlus - [find the link to install it here](https://tableplus.com/)
    3. IDE

2. Docker will need to be opened and running. Make sure checking the below:

<img style='width:50%' src='readme-images/docker.png'>

If this icon is green, you are ready for the next step.

3. Create an .env file, this is same as .env.example but changing the prefered details in the section below:

<img style='width:50%' src='readme-images/database-details.png'>

You will need to use this information after to connect the database with the server.

run:
```
./vendor/bin/sail composer require fruitcake/laravel-cors
```
then:

```
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

Go to [alias page](alias.md) to know how to create an alias and simplify this command. Please note, we will use the simplify command in the following steps.

This will take a bit to install all, once is all done, check on docker if all task are running. Something similar to:

If any task is not running, expand the container and click play in the task missing to make it run.

4. Connect your database on TablePlus.
    1. Open tablePlus and create a new connection.
    2. Enter the details you added on the .env
    3. Click test to make sure all is correct
    4. Connect

5. Run migrations script to have the db up to date:

```
sail artisan migrate
```

You should have the database up to date and ready to be tried!
